The IATI Activities Standard
============================

The activity standard is designed for reporting the details of individual aid activities. An activity is defined by the reporting organisation – depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.

The activity standard is the most widely used part of IATI. A reporting organisation will typically produce one IATI activity file per country or geographical region.

The standard supports around forty different fields, referenced by standard code lists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.

What information is inside an IATI activity?
--------------------------------------------

An IATI activity can answer some or all of the following questions:

* What is the name and description of the activity?
* Who is involved, and what is their role?
* Where is the activity geographically?
* When is/did the activity taking place?
* What documents help us find out more?
* How is the activity classified and categorised?
* What are the activity’s financial details, including transactions over time?
* What are the expected and actual results?

Organisations publish IATI activities within an IATI XML Activity File. A file can detail one or many activities, and a organisation can publish one or many files. It is expected that these files are updated as activities progress, and are made available via the IATI Registry.
