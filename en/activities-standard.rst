The IATI Activities Standard
============================

Definition
----------
The **IATI activity standard** is designed for reporting the details of individual aid activities. 

| An activity is defined by the reporting organisation.  Depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.

| The **IATI activity standard** is the most widely used part of IATI.  The activity standard supports around forty different fields, referenced by standard codelists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.

| Organisations publish this data in an :doc:`activity file </organisation-standard/overview/activity-file/>`.  It is expected that every organisation publishing IATI data should include one *actvity file*, which is updated at least annually.

| A *actvity file* can detail one or many activities, and a organisation can publish one or many files.


What information is inside an IATI activity?
--------------------------------------------
When declaring information using the **IATI activity standard** the following should be considered:

* What is the :ref:`name, description </activity-standard/overview/activity/>` and :ref:`identifier </activity-standard/overview/iati-identifier/>` of the activity?
* What :ref:`dates </activity-standard/overview/dates/>` help describe the timeframe of the activity?
* Which :ref:`organisations </activity-standard/overview/organisations/>` are involved, and what is their role?
* Where is the activity :ref:`geographically </activity-standard/overview/geographically/>`?
* How is the activity :ref:`classified </activity-standard/overview/classifications/>`?
* What are the activityâ€™s financial details, including :ref:`budgets </activity-standard/overview/budgets/>` and :ref:`transactions </activity-standard/overview/transactions/>` over time?
* What are the expected and actual :ref:`results </activity-standard/overview/results/>`?
* How is the activity :ref:`linked </activity-standard/overview/related-data/>` to other activities?
* What :ref:`linked-documents </activity-standard/overview/linked-documents/>` help us find out more?
* What are the designated :ref:`contact details </activity-standard/overview/related-data/>` for the activity?
