Rulesets
========
The **IATI rulesets** provide additional guidance and verification for IATI publishers.

* Individual *rules* detail any constraint or condition to be considered.  
* Collectively, these rules then make up a *ruleset*.

| Currently, there is one ruleset applicable to the **IATI standard** - named the *standard ruleset*.  This consists of two rules:

* ``Starts with`` - conditions around the formation of the ``iati-identifier``
* ``Date order`` - logics around the ordering of various date elements.

These rules are applicable to various elements within the IATI Standard.
