Guidance on publishing and using SDG data in IATI
----------------------------------------------------

Delivering sustainable development is at the heart of IATI’s vision and mission. Over the past years, changes have been made to the IATI Standard which allow data publishers to ‘tag’ their published activities, and their corresponding results, to the SDG Goals, Targets and Indicators.

In 2019 the SDG working group was set up to research and produce guidance on how SDG data should be reported through IATI.

The new guidance on how to publish and use SDG data in IATI is here:
