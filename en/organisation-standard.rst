=====================
This section details the **IATI Organisation standard**. See `here <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-data/organisation-infromation/>`__ for an in introduction to the organisation standard.

* IATI organisation :doc:`elements <organisation-standard/iati-organisations>` - details on each and every element and attribute of the standard, including relevant code lists, rules and example usage.
* A :doc:`summary table <organisation-standard/summary-table>` provides an overview of all aspects of the organisation standard.
* An :doc:`example XML file <organisation-standard/example-xml>` is provided, which is also used throughout the documentation.

Definition
----------
| The **IATI organisational standard** is used to describe one or more organisations involved in any stage development cooperation (funding, implementing etc.).

| It is designed to report *forward-looking aggregate budget* information for the reported organisations, and planned future budgets to recipient institutions or countries.

| The **IATI organisational standard** is also used to report links to relevant public documents.

| Organisations publish this data in an :doc:`organisation file </organisation-standard/overview/organisation-file/>`.  It is expected that every organisation publishing IATI data should include one *organisation file*, which is updated at least annually.


Considerations
--------------
| When declaring information using the **IATI organisation standard** the following should be considered:

* Who are the :doc:`Organisations </organisation-standard/overview/iati-organisation/>` involved?
* How are the :doc:`Organisations </organisation-standard/overview/organisations/>` unquiely identified?
* What are the organisation’s planned future annual total :doc:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>`?
* What are the organisation’s planned future :doc:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>` for aid given to recipient countries?
* What are the organisation’s planned future :doc:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>` for aid given to recipient organisations?
* Where are the organisation’s official public :doc:`documents </organisation-standard/overview/documents/>`?
