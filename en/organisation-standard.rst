The IATI Organisation Standard
==============================

Definition
----------
The **IATI organisational standard** is used to describe one or more organisations involved in the aid delivery chain. 

It is designed to report *forward-looking aggregate budget* information for the reported organisations, and planned future budgets to recipient institutions or countries.

The **IATI organisational standard** is also used to report links to relevant public documents. 

Organisations publish this data in an :doc:`organisation file </organisation-standard/overview/organisation-file/>`.  It is expected that every organisation publishing IATI data should include one *organisation file*, which is updated at least annually.


Considerations
--------------
When declaring information using the **IATI organisation standard** the following should be considered:

* Who are the :ref:`Organisations </organisation-standard/overview/organisations/>` involved, what are they named and identified as?
* What are the organisation’s planned future annual total :ref:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>`?
* What are the organisation’s planned future :ref:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>` for aid given to recipient countries?
* What are the organisation’s planned future :ref:`budgets </organisation-standard/overview/budgets/>` for aid given to recipient organisations?
* Where are the organisation’s official public :ref:`documents </organisation-standard/overview/documents/>`?
