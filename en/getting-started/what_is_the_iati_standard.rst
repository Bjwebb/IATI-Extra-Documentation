What Is The IATI Standard
=========================

The Standard sets guidelines for publishing information about aid spending. 
It does not create a new database. IATI will not replace work already being done by organisations such as the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to produce statistics about past aid flows and aid activities. Instead, IATI builds on, and goes beyond the standards and definitions that have already been agreed.
