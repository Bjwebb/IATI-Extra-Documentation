Budgets
=======

Definition
----------
Within the IATI organisation standard three types of budgets can be declared.  These all relate to the specific ``iati-organisation`` being described:

*total-budget - 
*recipient-org-budget
*recipient-country-budget


Considerations
--------------
IATI expects that budgets in the organisation standard are forward-looking
It is recommended, where possible, that budgets are presented for the next three financial years

Financial years can be presented using the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` dates

It is expected that the financial years for ``iati-organisation`` would be described 

It is possible to report periods other than years, but this is not recommended.

It is strongly recommended that the start and end of the reported financial years match those of the recipient countryâ€™s budgetary/planning cycle.

It is possible to report budget values in multiple currencies
