Budgets
=======

Definition
----------
Within the IATI organisation standard three types of budgets can be declared.  

These all relate to the specific ``iati-organisation`` being described:

* ``total-budget`` 
* ``recipient-org-budget``
* ``recipient-country-budget``


Considerations
--------------
IATI expects that budgets in the organisation standard are forward-looking.

It is recommended, where possible, that budgets are presented for the next three financial years.

It is possible to report periods other than years, but this is not recommended.

Financial years can be presented using the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` dates.

It is expected that the financial years for ``iati-organisation`` would be described.

It is strongly recommended that the ``period-start`` and ``period-end`` of the financial years described for any ``recipient-country-budget`` match the budgetary/planning cycle of the ``recipient-country``.

It is possible to report budget values in multiple currencies
