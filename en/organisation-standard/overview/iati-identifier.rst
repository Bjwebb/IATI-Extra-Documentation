IATI Identifier
===============

Definition
----------
Within the **IATI organisation standard**, the ``iati-identifier`` is the unique reference for an ``iati-organisation``



Considerations
--------------
When declaring an *iati-identifier* in the **IATI organisation standard** the following should be considered:

* The ``iati-identifier`` must be unique for every ``iati-organisation``. 

* The ``iati-identifier` should have no leading or trailing whitespace

* It is recommended that no forward slashes (/) or spaces should be contained within the ``iati-identifier``

* The ``iati-identifier`` in the **IATI organisation standard** is not the same as the ``iati-identifier`` in the **IATI activity standard**
