IATI Identifier
===============

Definition
----------
Within the **IATI organisation standard**, the ``iati-identifier`` is the unique reference for an ``iati-organisation``

| The ``iati-identifier`` in the **IATI organisation standard** is not the same as the ``iati-identifier`` in the **IATI activity standard**

Considerations
--------------
When using the **IATI organisation standard** to declare an *iati-identifier*, the following should be considered:

* The ``iati-identifier`` must be unique for every ``iati-organisation``. 

* The ``iati-identifier` should have no leading or trailing whitespace

* It is recommended that no forward slashes (/) or spaces should be contained within the ``iati-identifier``

* It is recommended to avoid spaces and non-ascii characters.  

* For example:

** ``AA-AAA-123456789`` is preferable to ``AA-AAA 123456789``.
