Gain Senior Management Commitment
=================================

Whatever the incentives of an organisation for publishing IATI data, it is important that these are understood and supported by senior management and other staff throughout the organisation. IATI does involve an investment of resources to be a success and it can be important for senior management of an organisation or agency to recognise this, and ensure staff capacity is made available.
