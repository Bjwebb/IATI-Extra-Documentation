Definition
----------
Within the **IATI activity standard** it is possible to describe items specific to CRS++ and/or the OECD DAC Forward Spending Survey:

* ``crs-add`` - additional items specific to CRS++ reporting.
* ``fss``  - allows entry of data required for the OECD DAC Forward Spending Survey at an activity level.
