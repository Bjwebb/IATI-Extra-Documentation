IATI Identifier
===============

Definition
----------
Within the **IATI activity standard**, the ``iati-identifier`` is the unique reference for an an activity

The ``iati-identifier`` is a concatenation of the ``reporting-org`` reference and the unique ``iati-activity`` identifier allocated by the ``reporting-org``.

* ``other-identifier``

Considerations
--------------
The ``iati-identifier`` must be unique for every ``iati-activity`` within the complete dataset published 

The ``iati-identifier` should have no leading or trailing whitespace

It is recommended that no forward slashes (/) or spaces should be contained within the ``iati-identifier``


Further guidance
----------------
iati-identifier
iati-activity
reporting-org
