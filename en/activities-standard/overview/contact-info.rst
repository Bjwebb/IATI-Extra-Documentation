Contact Info
============

Definition
----------
The **IATI activity standard** enables ``contact-info`` to be included for any ``iati-activity``

The following fields can be described:

* ``organisation``
* ``person-name``
* ``job-title``
* ``telephone``
* ``email``
* ``mailing-address``
* ``website``

Considerations
--------------
Any ``contact-info`` should include at least one of the available fields.

More than one ``contact-info`` can be included within an ``iati-activity``

Careful attention should be paid to personal data being published.  Always include organisational ``contact-info``.
