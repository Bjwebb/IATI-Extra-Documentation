Contact Info
============

Definition
----------
The **IATI activity standard** enables ``contact info`` to be included for any ``iati-activity``

| The following fields can be described:

* ``organisation``
* ``person-name``
* ``job-title``
* ``telephone``
* ``email``
* ``mailing-address``
* ``website``

Considerations
--------------
When using the **IATI activity standard** to declare *contact info*, the following should be considered:

* Any ``contact-info`` should include at least one of the available fields.

* More than one ``contact-info`` can be included within an ``iati-activity``

* Use of the ``ContactType`` code is recommended, especially when declaring multiple ``contact-info``

* Careful attention should be paid to personal data being published.  Always include organisational ``contact-info``.

* For ``telephone`` pay attention to international dialling codes.  Avoid presentation of internal ``telephone`` numbers.

* The free-text instances of ``organisation``, ``person-name``, ``job-title`` and ``mailing-address`` should avoid use of text in CAPITALS, where possible.
