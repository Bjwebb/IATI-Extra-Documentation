Container Elements
==================

Definition
----------
The **IATI activity standard** enables the publishing of information on measurable results from an ``iati-activity``, through use of the ``result`` element.
 
Considerations
--------------
Any ``iati-activity can have either one or multiple ``result``

A ``result`` should have a ``title`` and a ``description`` to clarify the information being detailed

Every ``result`` should include an ``indicator``, which in turn details a period of time, and then a ``target`` and ``actual`` measure.

It is also recommended to include a ``baseline`` measure for each ``result`` recorded.

Any ``target``, ``actual`` and ``baseline`` can have attached a ``comment`` to provide additional narrative or information.
