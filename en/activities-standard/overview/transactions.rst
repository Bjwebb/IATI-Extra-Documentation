Transactions
============
Transactions are the building blocks of IATI. They detail the flow of money between organisations. 

There are several possible types of transactions, with the most common being:

Commitment - the total agreed budget for the activity.
Disbursement - the amount transferred to another organisation in the aid delivery chain (e.g. a partner organisation that you fund).
Expenditure - the outlay on goods and services.
Incoming funds - the funds received from an external funding source (e.g. a donor).

A transaction should always have a date and a value

A transaction should always be in the past.
