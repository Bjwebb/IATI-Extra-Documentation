Title & description
===================

Definition
----------
Within the **IATI activity standard** a human-readable title and description for an ``iati-activity`` can be assigned using

* ``title``
* ``description``


Considerations
--------------
It is recommended that the ``title`` should be concise and jargon-free

A ``description`` can have different focal points, based on the ``DescriptionType`` codelist

Both the ``title`` and ``descriptions`` can be repeated for different languages.  

When an ``iati-activity`` is implemented in a ``recipient-country`` where the language is different to that of the ``reporting-org``, it is recommended that country specific language(s) are provided.
