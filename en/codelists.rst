Codelists
=========

The **IATI codelists** are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers **comparable**. Numerical codes are used to represent many standard values in an IATI file – for example, organisation types such as “Government” or “National NGO”. Standard sector codes and organisational identifiers are also supported.

The IATI codelists ensure activity and organisation information is **comparable between different publishers**.

Codes for fields such as :doc:`organisation type <codelist/OrganisationType>` (e.g. 23 = Regional NGO; 60 = Foundation; or 70 = Private Sector) ensure that different publishers have unambiguous, comparable definitions they can use when describing aid activities.

The codes use existing authority lists where possible and build on codes published by the ISO, OECD DAC, COFOG and Guidestar.
