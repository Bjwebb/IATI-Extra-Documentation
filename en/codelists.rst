Codelists
=========
The **IATI codelists** are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers **comparable**.

| Codes are used to represent many standard values in an **IATI activity**. For example, codelists such as :doc:`organisation type </codelists/OrganisationType>` ensure that different publishers have unambiguous, comparable definitions (e.g. 23 = Regional NGO; 60 = Foundation; or 70 = Private Sector) they can use when describing activities.

| Codelists are updated through a `managed process <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/upgrades/how-we-manage-the-standard/codelist-management/>`__.  A codelist can either be embedded (centrally managed by IATI) or non-embedded (derived from an authority source).

| For every codelist, the embedded status, alongside the relevant IATI element(s) are declared and linked to.

| An `API is also available <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/developer/codelist-api/>`__ for accessing codelists.
